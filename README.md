# Maximize WhatsApp [WIP]

#### Enable full screen on large aspect ratio screens on WhatsApp Web.

1. [Enable Epiphany extension](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-enable-extensions). _Optional if not done._
2. Download the latest release from the [.xpi file](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Maximize-Whatsapp/releases/).
3. Follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/GNOME-Web-Extensions/Get-Started/wiki#how-to-install-extensions).


## Roadmap
Perhaps you may be asking yourself "Why would I need this extension if my monitor shows WhatsApp Web is already full screen?" If you asked yourself this question it means that you don't have the same hassle of seeing a small container on the screen with chat since your monitor doesn't have a large aspect ratio.
